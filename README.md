# 💱 Currency Converter
Currency Converter is a **lightweight React-based project** that allows you to convert values between different currencies in real-time using a reliable exchange rate API.

This is an independent mini-project that is also part of my *WIP project* called **Modular Utils.**

All modules can be used **standalone**, but they were designed to also work together inside **Modular Utils as a collection of utilities.**


## 🚀 Features
- Input any amount and convert between currencies.
- Select a base currency and a target currency.
- Fetch real-time exchange rates from a trusted API.
- Validate inputs to prevent empty or invalid submissions.
- Display the converted value instantly.
- Friendly messages for errors, missing inputs, or invalid values.
